# KPI Analysis Summary

The simulated results show that as network load increases, 5G maintains
lower latency and higher throughput compared to 4G.

This reflects architectural improvements in 5G, such as a more flexible
core network and improved handling of high user density.

The simulation is illustrative and intended for learning purposes.
